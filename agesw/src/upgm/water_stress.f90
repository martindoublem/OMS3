subroutine water_stress(adjgdd,bhfwsf,dummy2,gddwsf,row,i)
!
! this subroutine takes the input water stress factor and based on the
! default gdd for stressed (wsf = 0) and non-stressed (wsf = 1)conditions
! calculates the number of gdd for each growth stage of the current crop.
 
! use the current day's water stress factor to adjust the gdd required
! to reach the next growth stage
 
! debe need to pass the gddwsf array so that phenol cropname has access to
! it.

! gddwsf is an array to hold the gdd values for gn and gs which are read in
! from upgm_crop.dat. gddwsf also holds the two wsf values for each growth
! stage.
! debe added a fifth column in gddwsf to hold the adjgdd value for each growth
! stage.
! debe added the variable (adjgdd) to hold the adjusted gdd value for entering
! a growth stage.

!     + + + argument definitions + + +
!     adjgdd - the adjusted gdd required to enter the growth stage.
!     bhfwsf - water stress factor ratio (0-1).  this is read in daily.
!     dummy2 - an array to hold the gdd values, both under stressed
!     and non- stressed conditions,required to reach each growth stage of
!     the current crop.
!     gddwsf - an array to hold the gn and gs gdd values plus the
!     high and low water stress factor values.  these are used in
!     caluclating the slope of the line for each growth stage and this
!     is then used to calculate the adjusted gdd value for the current
!     growth stage.
!     column one contains the gn values and is y2.
!     column two contains the gs value and is y1.
!     column three contains wsfhi (high water stress) and is x1.
!     column four contains wsflo (low water stress) and is x2.
!     column five contains the adjgdd value for the stage.
!     i - variable used to control which row in dummy 2 is used. it is passed
!       in from the calling subroutine.
!     row - selects the row to be filled in the gddwsf array.
 
!     + + + local variable definitions + + +
!     j - selects the appropriate column in the selected row in gddwsf array.
!     m - the slope of the line.  the change in y over the change in x.
!     n - used to skip down to the gs values in dummy2 array.
!     wsfhi - a high water stress factor value, eg. .4  0 = complete stress
!     wsflo - a low water stress factor value, eg. .8   1 = no stress
!     x - the x value that is filled with the current water stress factor (bhfwsf)
!       in the point slope equation for the line
!     y - the y value when x is known in the point slope equation for the
!       line. this holds the new adjusted gdd value and is saved in the
!       variable adjgdd.
!
! set parameter values.  currently hardwiring the same value for all stages.
