call gddcalc(bctmin,bwtdmn,bwtdmx,gddday,gmethod,tbase,toptlo,toptup,tupper)
 
 
!debe moved the next two lines of code out of the 'if (huiy.lt.1.0) then'
! statement so that hrs growth stage will show the amounts for dap and
! gdds. this is because hrs growth stage occurs after huiy.lt.1.0 and
! these 2 values will not be incremented for the hrs stage.  the values
! are available for shoot_grow and emerge because they are saved in the
! save statement above.

!if emergence has occurred, call phenol and leaf number subroutines.
!debe added the variables to pass to phenol for leaf number and crop
!phenol subroutines.
 
!debe moved call to leafno subroutine before the call to phenol
!subroutine.
 
! ***** leafno *****
!  call the leafno subroutine to calculate the number of leaves once

! ***** phenology *****
!phenol calls the appropriate phenol routine for the current crop being
! simulated.
!debe passed dap calculated above to dap in phenol instead of sending it
! bcdayap (the weps variable). also passed gdds to phenol instead
! of bcthucum.
!debe moved the call to phenol before testing if tillering or anthesis
! has occurred so that if either has the accumulation of gdd and days
! after these stages can begin on the same day that it actually occurred.
 
!debe added bhfwsf (weps/upgm variable)to the call to phenol to implement
! daily water stress effect on time of reaching a growth stage.
!debe added gddwsf array to pass to phenol.  the gddwsf array holds the
! number of gdd required to reach each growth stage based on the
! water stress factor.
 
!debe added variables to pass to the phenol_cropname subroutines for
!printing out information: bc0growdepth, gmethod, emrgflg, cliname
!debe added canht to pass to phenol to be written in phenol.out from
!phenol_cropname. debe added variables for dry beans.
