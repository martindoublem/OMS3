subroutine date1(gsarray)
!
!  debe added from phenologymms as a starting point for adding emergence
!  to upgm.
 
!  the date1 subroutine receives an array with daynum and year values.
!  date1 first determines if the year is a leap year. if it is it changes
!  the value of the number of days for february and the total number of days
!  of the year to those appropriate for a leap year. date1 then fills the
!  other array positions with the month and day for the daynum in
!  position 1 of the array.
 
!  check inputs and outputs!!!!!!!!
 
!  inputs:  list variables here with c and r for each variable
 
!  outputs: list variables here with c and r for each variable

!     gsarray - this holds the date values passed into date1.  it is an
!               array and contains daynum, and the year, month and day for
!               daynum. date1 determines the month and day based on
!               daynum and year.
 
!     + + + local variable definitions + + +
!     month - the month that daynum occurs in.
!     ndays - an array that holds the number of days in each month.  the
!             value for february changes if date1 determines it is a leap
!             year.
!     ndayyr - this holds the number of days for year passed to date1.  if
!              date1 determines it is a leap year the ndayyr value is
!              changed to 366. this variable is not really 'used' it is
!              only given a value based on whether it is a leap year or
!              not. left it in, in case it is needed in the future.
!     year - this is the year value.  it can be 1, 2, etc. or the actual
!            calendar year.
