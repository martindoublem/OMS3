!
!debe dummy1 is not currently used here or passed on but left it here in
! case it is used in the future. ! verns is also not currently used.
!debe added growth_stress because it is now being read in from a file.
!debe added variables for dry beans in call to phenol.
!debe added temperature variables toptlo, topup, tbase.
!debe added canopyflg.
!debe added ecanht so that it can be read in instead of set in the code for each crop.
!debe  - growth stage variables are now declared and initialized in main via cropinit.
! phenolflg is read in from upgm_crop.dat. these are now passed into crop from main via callcrop.
!
! ***** emergence *****
!
!debe added the following emergence arguments so that they can be passed to
! shoot_grow. these include seedsw, cropname, soilwat, wfpslo, wfpsup,
! germgdd, ergdd, gddday, gddtbg.  ac0nam is passed into cropname in main to
! be passed to emerge.
!debe added the emergence flag (emrgflg)to determine whether to call the
! emerge subroutine or not.
!debe added icli to pass to emerge to enable printing the weather file name
! in emerge.out. also, added pd,pm,py to print planting date in emerge.out.
! later changed to using cliname to print the weather file name.  it is read
! in from the header in the climate file.
!debe changed seedsw from integer to real to allow moving a half soil moisture level.
! later changed it back because array subscripts must be integers or constants.
!debe added two new arrays of 6 elements to be used in emerge.for to
! enable adding values for germgdd and ergdd for two soil moisture
! levels that are half steps between dry and medium and medium and optimum.
!debe added tempsw to be passed to cinit to be initialized and then used in emerge.
!
! ***** phenology *****
!
!debe added aepa and first7 because they are initialized in cropinit and
! need to be passed to crop. other phenology variables include: dummy2,
! pchron.
!
! ***** gddcalc *****
!
!debe added the variable for the maximum upper temperature (tupper) value
!and tbase, toptlo, topup values.
! read in from upgm_crop.dat in main. it will be passed from crop to
! gddcalc.
!debe added callgdd which is initialized in cropinit and used in crop.
!debe added gmethod passed into crop which is read in from upgm_crop.dat
! in main.
!
! ***** canopyht *****
!
!debe added maxht, read in from upgm_crop in main and passed to canopyht.
! add canht so the final canopy height can be passed back to main and
! printed in phenol.out.
!debe added canopyflg to determine which method of calculating plant height
! will be used. if 0, use weps/upgm method; if 1, use phenologymms method.
!debe added dayhtinc to be able to pass the daily increase in height to growth
! for the ht_dia_sai subroutine in place of the weps variable dht when
! canopyflg = 1.
!
! ***** co2 *****
!debe added co2x, co2y for the co2 arrays and co2atmos for the atmospheric co2 level.
! Also, added co2eff which will be the effect of the read-in atmospheric co2 
! level on the plant, i.e., the adjustment factor. Nedded to have it initialized before calculating 
! this value in Growth.f90
