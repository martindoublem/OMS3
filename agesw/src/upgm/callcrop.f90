!debe 082508 removed sram0jd-plant_jday+1 from the subroutine argument list
! because this caused many errors. i think a mistake was made in copying in
! the passing arguments from main. the first two arguments are (daysim, sr)
! in the callcrop subroutine in the 081308 archived copy. i put daysim back
! in as the first arguement in place of 'sram0jd-plant_jday+1' and sr in
! place of 1. this fixed the problem.
!debe added growth_stress because it is now read in.
!debe added canopyflg so that it can be passed on to crop.
!
! ***** emergence *****
!
!debe added the emergence arguments so that they can be passed to crop.
! these include seedsw, cropname, soilwat, wfpslo, wfpsup, germgdd,
! ergdd, gddday, gddtbg.  ac0nam is passed into cropname in main to be passed to
! emerge.
!debe added the emergence flag (emrgflg)to determine whether to call the
! emerge subroutine or not.
!debe added icli to pass to emerge to enable printing the weather file name
! in emerge.out. also, added pd,pm,py to print planting date in emerge.out.
! debe changed seedsw to real to allow moving a half soil moisture level.
! later changed back to integer because array subscripts should be integers.
!debe added two new arrays of 6 elements to be used in emerge.for to
! enable adding values for germgdd and ergdd for two soil moisture
! levels that are half steps between dry and medium and medium and optimum.
!
! ***** phenology *****
!
!debe added aepa and first7 because they are initialized in cropinit and need
! to be passed to crop. other phenology variables include: dummy1, dummy2,
! pchron.
!
! ***** gddcalc *****
!
!debe added the variable for the maximum upper temperature (tupper) value
! read in from upgm_crop.dat in main and passed into callcrop which will
! pass it to crop and then to gddcalc.
!debe added callgdd to be passed on to crop where it is used.
!
! ***** canopyht *****
!debe added maxht read in from upgm_crop. also, canht so that crop can pass
! it back to main and print the final canopy height in phenol.out.
!debe added canopyflg to determine which method of determining canopyheight
!will be used. i canoyflg=0, the weps/upgm method will be used, if it
!equals 1, the phenologymms method will be used.
!debe added dayhtinc to be able to pass the daily increase in height to growth
! for the ht_dia_sai subroutine in place of the weps/upgm variable dht when
! canopyflg = 1.
!debe added ecanht for height of phase 1 of canopy growth.
!    
! ***** co2 *****
!debe added co2x, co2y for the co2 arrays and co2atmos for the atmospheric co2 level.
