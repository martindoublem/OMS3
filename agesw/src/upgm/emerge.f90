!
!  debe added the emerge subroutine from phenologymms to begin implementing
!  emergence in upgm. after getting information from fred fox it appears
!  that it is best to call emerge from shoot_grow.for. 07/23/2008
!
!  upgm original pdepth (=growdepth, becomes bc0growdepth) was 2.5cm and
!  phenologymms was 5cm. however, upgm seems to work better with a 4 cm
!  depth, so crop parameter files set to 4 cm pdepth.
!
!  the emerge subroutine calculates the thermal time for germination
!  (germgdd)and elongation rate in mm/gdd (ergdd) for different crops
!  based on the soil water content of the seedbed (seedsw). this
!  subroutine is based on the shootgro model (wilhelm et al., 1993.
!  ecological modelling 68:183-203).
!
!  the soil water level must be input to the emerge subroutine. currently it
!  is read in from the upgm_crop.dat file. 1 = optimum, 2 = medium, 3 = dry,
!  and 4 = planted in dust. the parameters for each crop are also in the
!  upgm_crop.dat file.
!
!  the gdd required for germination increases and elongation rate
!  decreases as water content decreases.  after planting, precipitation
!  can shift the level towards optimum conditions, but there is no
!  provision for reducing the soil level based on evaporation.
!
!  inputs:  dap(r), daynum(r), ddap(20)(c), dgdds(20)(c), elong(c,r),
!           ems(c,r), ergdd(4)(r), gddday(r), gdds(r), germgdd(4)(r),
!           germs(c,r), pdepth(r), precip(r), seedsw(c,r)
!
!  outputs: ddap(20)(c), dgdds(20)(c), elong(c,r), ems(c,r),
!           germs(c,r), seedsw(c,r)
!
!  debe 081308 added the following comments:
!     weps/upgm variables passed into emerge subroutine variables:
!     doy into daynum
!     bc0growdepth into pdepth  note: must convert from meters (bc0growdepth)
!         to cm (pdepth)!!!
!
!  debe replaced 'bc0growdepth' with 'pdepth' in the passing arguments in the subroutine
!  list above. 'bc0growdepth' (upgm variable name) is passed into 'pdepth' (phenologymms
!  variable) name.
!  debe changed the upgm variable name 'yy' to the phenologymms variable name 'year'.
!  the upgm value for year is passed into the phenologymms variable 'year'.
!  the upgm variables pd, pm, py and cliname are passed to emerge to allow printing these
!  values to the output file emerge.out.
!  debe added two new six element arrays ggdd and egdd with two positions for intermediate values
!  at intermediate soil moisture levels in positions 2 and 4. later passed in tempsw, the array
!  index value for these two arrays. it is initialized in cinit.
!

!debe made dap an integer, (it was a real in phenologymms).
!debe added yy from crop for the year. later changed this so that the 'yy' value is
!passed into the phenologymms variable 'year'.
!debe added six element arrays to handle two intermediate soil moisture levels: ggdd, egdd.
 
!debe made pdepth a real, (it was an integer in phenologymms).
!debe changed seedsw from integer to real to allow moving half a soil moisture level with precip.
! later changed back to an integer because array subscripts must be integers or constants.
!debe made soilwat character* (80) to agree with the other subroutines in which it is used.
!debe changed character size to 40 from 80. seedbed and cropname are 40.
!debe added seedbed, emrgflg, pd, pm, py to print out the values.
 
!debe added adjgermgdd and adjergdd variables to adjust the germgdd and ergdd values when moving
! only half a soil moisture level. later these were not needed because of adding the six element
! array and these two variables were no longer needed to hold the intermediate values. they were
! calculated and stored in elements 2 and 4.
 
!debe added pdepthnew to allow converting pdepth which receives the planting depth
!from upgm in meters and must be converted to cm. the converted value is held in
!pdepthnew.
