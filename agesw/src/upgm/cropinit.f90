!debe added emergence variables: seedsw, ergdd, germgdd, wfpslo, wfpsup,
! soilwat, gddtbg passed from main for initialization. added cliname to print
! out the name of the climate file.
!debe added growth_stress because it is now read in.
!debe added temperature variables, emrgflg, cropname and gmethod.
!debe changed seedsw from integer to real to allow moving half a soil moisture level.
! later changed it back to an integer becasue array subscripts must be integers or constants.
!debe added canopyflg.
!debe added dayhtinc to be able to pass the daily increase in height to growth
! for the ht_dia_sai subroutine in place of the weps/upgm variable dht when
! canopyflg = 1.
!debe added two new arrays of 6 elements to be used in emerge.for to
! enable adding values for germgdd and ergdd for two soil moisture
! levels that are half steps between dry and medium and medium and optimum.
!debe added ecanht so that it can be read in instead of set in the code for each crop.
!debe added all growth stage variables and phenolflg to be initialized here.
!debe added CO2 variables to be initialized here.
